Farming-rpg in HTML5

Changelog
==
<strong>v0.1</strong>
- cloned <a href="https://github.com/hpeinar/booman">Booman!</a>
- while holding down shift, arrow keys will only change your direction instead of moving
- changed out some of the sprites to match the new idea

Some thoughts of mine
==
- kick out the "panel" from game code and make it all new canvas layer (easier to manage it's drawing etc)
- inventory of some kind...
- plowing and potatoes!
- a infinite map
- find someone who could actually DRAW and spare few moments of their time to make some sprites for me


Little about it:
